# This is the configration file for the forza-pi-dash dashboard.
# The dashboard will edit this file itself via the settings, so there
# is no need to edit this file directly. Nevertheless, it will be
# explained below. Please don't delete this file - the dashboard
# will not run without it.
# ------------------------------------------------------------------

# port: The port that Forza should send the data to. This should match
# the port in the game, and should be between 1024 and 65535

# unitOptions: The options for the type of units the dash can be set to. Includes
# default, imperial and metric as standard, but users can add custom options if
# they want finer control over the individual units of a parameter. (Note, the
# paramConfig.yaml file also needs to be changed accordingly)

# units: The currently chosen units

# redlinePercent: The % of engine_max_rpm that current_engine_rpm needs
# to be for the gear indicator to turn red

# readyPercent: The % of engine_max_rpm that current_engine_rpm needs
# to be for the gear indicator to turn yellow

# tireTempBlue: The tire needs to be at or below this temperature to become blue
# tireTempYellow: The tire needs to be at or above this temperature to become yellow
# tireTempRed: The tire needs to be at or above this temperature to become red
# Note that the temperature specified for each tire should be in the units the user has chosen.

# pitWarning: Can be True or False. Controls whether the large centre
# red and yellow pit warning will flash when low on fuel. Note the
# smaller warning inside the fuel portion of the dash will always function.

# parameterList: A list of up to 4 parameters that directly translate
# to the parameters output by Forza, and displayed as part of the customisable
# 4-widget centre portion of the dash. Valid options for these parameters
# can be found in 'configuration_file.md'
